# Neovim Configuration Tutorial
## Start Configuration
To start configuration, Neovim loads all files in its runtime path here: <br>
`~/.config/nvim`
By default, `init.lua` in any folder will be run as its main function.
So we add a `init.lua` file inside our config directory: 
`touch ~/.config/nvim/init.lua`

## 1 - Initial Setup 
The initial setup branch shows how we can configure Neovim in `init.lua` and install some essential plugins.
